 * The work types are:
 * HANDSHAKE: Initial communication between two peers.

 * REQUEST: A peer have a request.
 * Requests are put on the work queue for consumption by the worker.
 *
 * DATA: Data, a response from a request.
 * A request can generate multible DATA responses.
 * Like requests, they are put on the work queue for consumption by the worker.
 *
 * PRIORITY: A priority message.
 * These are not put on the queue, but handled immidiately.
 * Examples may be message about an urgent problem, an emergency message (alarm) or an explicit instruction.
 * Immidiately, the peer responds with the CRC32 of the message, to prove to the reporter
 * that the message has been received before it invokes the callback.
 * In some cases it needs to know this to be able to start saving power or stop trying to send the message.
 * Emergency messages will be retried if the CRC32 doesn't match.
 *
 * ORCHESTRATION: This is about handling peers and controlling the mesh.
